When the bash script run an empty terminal opens, in this terminal the variable two variables HELLO and LOCAL can be accessed, as they were intialized in the .bashrc file, so any new terminal will be opened can access these two variables in it. 
However, the old terminal(The one we run the bash file in it)  cann't see or access these two variables, as it was opened with the .bashrc file before the editing.
